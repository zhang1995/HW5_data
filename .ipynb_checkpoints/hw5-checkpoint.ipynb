    "\n",
    "Using the \"nbasalariesfull.csv\" data set from HMK4, your goal is to build a Bokeh visualization which allows the user to explore how salary (on a log scale) varies with points per game (PSG) and age. You will create a visualization that allows the user to toggle the X axis of a scatter plot between PSG and age, with the y-axis always being log Salary. Also add the hover tool so that if the user hovers over a datapoint in the plot a window pops up that shows the player name, team, position, salary, and the current x variable (PSG or age) depending on the current tab.  Color each point according to a player's position and provide a legend for the colors. Add the ability to Zoom in/out.  Add slight horizontal jitter to a player's age.\n",
